# Prefix Trees, its derivatives and applications

## Introduction

In this team project we have explored how prefix trees work,
the derivatives of prefix trees, the algorithms used to build them
and the applications of it all.

We will start at the basis of the prefix tree - the tree.

## The tree

In graph theory, a tree is a connected acyclic undirected graph. More formally, a tree is a set of vertices (nodes) and edges that satisfies the following properties:

Connectedness: There is a path between any two vertices in the tree. In other words, for any pair of vertices in the tree, there exists a sequence of edges that connects them.

Acyclicity: There are no cycles in the tree. This means that it is not possible to start at a vertex and follow a sequence of edges that eventually returns to the same vertex.

Mathematically, a tree can be represented as a pair (V, E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. The set of vertices represents the nodes of the tree, and the set of edges represents the connections between the nodes.
